🟣 ExDesk
Unified Issue Tracking & Help Desk Solution.

Seamlessly transition from "Customer Ticket" to "Developer Issue" without switching tools.

ExDesk is an open-source platform designed to replace the fragmented workflow of using Zendesk for support and Jira for development. Built on the Elixir ecosystem (Phoenix LiveView), it delivers a blazingly fast, real-time user experience that legacy SPAs cannot match.

Stop paying per-seat pricing for slow software. Own your data, host it yourself, and let your teams collaborate in real-time.
