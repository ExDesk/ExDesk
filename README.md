## 📖 About ExDesk

**ExDesk** is an open-source **IT Service Management (ITSM)** platform designed to unify **Help Desk** operations and **IT Asset Management** into a single, cohesive interface.

Think of it as **Zendesk meets Snipe-IT**, but built on the **BEAM (Erlang VM)**.

Current ITSM solutions are often resource-heavy, expensive, or lack seamless integration between tickets and hardware assets. ExDesk solves this by leveraging **Elixir** and **Phoenix LiveView** to provide a fault-tolerant, highly concurrent, and real-time experience without the bloat.

### 🚀 Why ExDesk?

- **⚡ High Performance:** Designed to handle thousands of concurrent connections with low memory footprint.
- **🔄 Real-Time:** Instant updates on ticket status, chats, and asset tracking using Phoenix Channels.
- **🛡️ Fault Tolerant:** Built on the battle-tested Erlang OTP ecosystem.
- **💸 Open Source:** No per-agent licensing fees. You own your data.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📦 Asset Management (ITAM)
